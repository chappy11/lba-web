# Using Arrange Elimination Winners in Standings Page

## Overview
The standings page now includes a button to automatically arrange elimination winners based on their total scores from semifinal matches.

## Location
**File:** `/src/app/standing/page.tsx`  
**Button Component:** `/src/feature/teams/ArrangeWinnersButton.tsx`

## What It Does

When you click the "Arrange Elimination Winners" button:

1. **Fetches Elimination Data** - Gets the current elimination match schedule from Firebase
2. **Calculates Total Scores** - For each semifinal match, calculates:
   ```
   Team 1 Total = team1Score + team1MatchScore
   Team 2 Total = team2Score + team2MatchScore
   ```
3. **Determines Winners** - Identifies which team has the higher total score
4. **Updates Semifinals** - Sets the `winner` field for each semifinal match
5. **Advances to Finals** - Automatically places the two semifinal winners into the final match
6. **Saves to Firebase** - Persists all changes to the database
7. **Shows Results** - Displays a success popup with the winners and their scores
8. **Refreshes Page** - Reloads the page after 1 second to show updated data

## UI Features

### Button States
- **Default State**: Purple gradient button with trophy icon
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner with "Arranging Winners..." text
- **Success State**: Shows check icon with "Winners Arranged!" text
- **Disabled**: Button is disabled while processing or after success

### Success Popup
Shows:
- Number of semifinal winners
- List of advancing teams with their total scores
- Example: "Lakers (125 points)"

### Error Handling
If something goes wrong, shows error popup with specific message

## Usage Example

### In the Standings Page

```tsx
import ArrangeWinnersButton from "@/feature/teams/ArrangeWinnersButton"

export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Arrange Winners Button */}
      <div className="mb-8 flex justify-end">
        <ArrangeWinnersButton />
      </div>
      
      {/* Rest of standings content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## When to Use

Use this button when:
- ✅ Round-robin matches are complete
- ✅ Elimination bracket has been created
- ✅ Semifinal matches have been played (scores entered)
- ✅ You want to automatically determine and advance winners to the finals

## Visual Design

The button uses:
- `THEME.ACHIEVEMENT.GRADIENT` - Purple-pink gradient background
- Hover effect: Scales to 105% and increases shadow
- Active effect: Scales to 95%
- Smooth transitions (300ms duration)
