# Code Improvements - Match Schedule Service

## Problem Fixed
There was an issue in the elimination round update logic where both semifinal winners could potentially update the same field (team1 or team2) in the FINAL match, causing one team to overwrite the other.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Final Match Team Assignment Logic
**File**: `src/_lib/services/MatchSchedule.service.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
team1: match?.team1 === "" ? teamWinner : match?.team1,
team2: match?.team2 === "" && match?.team1 !== ""
    ? teamWinner
    : match?.team2,
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Determine which slot to fill based on current state
const isTeam1Empty = !match?.team1 || match?.team1 === ""
const isTeam2Empty = !match?.team2 || match?.team2 === ""

// If team1 is empty, fill team1. Otherwise, fill team2
const shouldFillTeam1 = isTeam1Empty
const shouldFillTeam2 = !isTeam1Empty && isTeam2Empty

return {
  ...match,
  team1: shouldFillTeam1 ? teamWinner : match?.team1,
  team2: shouldFillTeam2 ? teamWinner : match?.team2,
  team1Logo: shouldFillTeam1 ? teamWinnerLogo : match?.team1Logo,
  team2Logo: shouldFillTeam2 ? teamWinnerLogo : match?.team2Logo,
  team1Id: shouldFillTeam1 ? updatePayload?.winner : match?.team1Id,
  team2Id: shouldFillTeam2 ? updatePayload?.winner : match?.team2Id,
}
```

**Why This Fix Works**:
- Explicitly checks if team1 is empty first
- If team1 is empty, assigns the winner to team1
- If team1 is NOT empty but team2 is empty, assigns the winner to team2
- This ensures the first semifinal winner goes to team1 and the second goes to team2
- Prevents both teams from being assigned to the same ID

### 2. Additional Code Quality Improvements

#### Fixed TypeScript Type Issues
- Changed `removeUndefinedFields` parameter type from `any` to `unknown`
- Added explicit return type annotation: `unknown`
- Added type assertion in `updateMatches`: `as Partial<SeasonGames>`

#### Fixed ESLint Issues
- Changed unused parameter `_` to `,` (no parameter name)
- Removed unused `error` parameter in catch block (changed to `catch {}`)

## How It Works Now

1. When the first semifinal match is won, the winner is assigned to:
   - `team1` (because it's empty)
   - `team1Logo`
   - `team1Id`

2. When the second semifinal match is won, the winner is assigned to:
   - `team2` (because team1 is already filled)
   - `team2Logo`
   - `team2Id`

3. Both teams are now correctly populated in the FINAL match with unique IDs

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create an elimination tournament
2. Complete both semifinal matches
3. Verify that the FINAL match shows two different teams
4. Verify that team1 and team2 have different IDs
5. Complete the FINAL match and verify the correct winner is displayed
